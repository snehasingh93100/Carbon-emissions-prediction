# 🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction – (Internship Project - June 2025 Batch)

## 📁 Project Description

This project is part of the AI/ML Internship (June Batch – Week 1).  
This project is part of the AI/ML Internship (June Batch – 2025).  
The goal is to explore and prepare a climate dataset (CO₂ emissions & other greenhouse gases) for future ML tasks.

## 🚀 Ready for Week 2

The dataset is now cleaned and prepared, ready for:
- Visualization
- Machine Learning model building (Regression, Forecasting, etc.)
## ✅ Week 2 Milestone Completed: Stage 2 – Data Exploration & Visualization - (24 june,2025)

- *Imported Cleaned Dataset:* Used data_clean.csv generated in Stage 1.
- *Visualized Global Trends:* Plotted relationships between CO₂ emission and country-specific indicators.
- *Explored Columns and Units:* Identified key columns and decoded abbreviations from the dataset.
- *Feature Engineering:* Selected relevant features and removed unnecessary ones.
- *Created Visualizations:*
  - Correlation matrix heatmap for feature dependencies
  - Scatterplots to examine distribution
  - Histograms for pattern discovery
  - Outlier detection using visual tools
- *Detected Dependencies & Trends:* Observed connections and trends in the data based on the visualizations.
